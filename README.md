# Birthday_Cake_App
A Java-based Birthday Celebration application developed using Swing and AWT, designed to demonstrate core Java graphics, animation, and event-driven programming 
concepts. The application accepts user input such as name, age, cake flavor, and icing color, and dynamically renders a personalized birthday scene featuring a 
multi-layer cake, age candle, animated banner, balloons, and continuous falling confetti. Smooth animations are handled using a Swing Timer, with all logic executed 
in runtime memory without any external libraries or database. This project highlights effective use of core Java, OOP principles, and creative graphical UI design in 
a standalone desktop application
